# Surrey-Year-3-Project

This is the Year 3 Project conducted in the University of Surrey in partial fulfilment for the degree of Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Electronic Engineering with Computer Systems.

The objectives of this particular project includes:
- Establishing and unifying the theoretical foundations of machine learning and various deep learning state-of-the-art technologies and apply them to image super-resolution.

- Demonstrates impacts by differing hyper-parameters and network configurations, in particular the use of perceptual loss, effect of sub-pixel convolution versus resize convolution and skip-connections

## Super-resolved Results
All original results and visualisations in the LaTeX document are available on Google Drive:

## TODO
The code is poorly managed due to difficulties incurred by accessibility to the university's server and inability to test them. 

TODO List:
- Code-base cleanup

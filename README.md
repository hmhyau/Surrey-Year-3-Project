# Surrey-Year-3-Project

This is the Year 3 Project conducted in the University of Surrey in partial fulfilment for the degree of Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Electronic Engineering with Computer Systems.

The objectives of this particular project includes:
- Establishes and unifies the theoretical foundations of machine learning and various deep learning state-of-the-art technologies and applies them to image super-resolution.

- Demonstrates impacts by differing hyper-parameters and network configurations, in particular the use of perceptual loss, the effect of sub-pixel convolution versus resize convolution and skip-connections.

## DIV2K Dataset
[DIV2K Dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) is a publicly available dataset used in the NTIRE challenge on super-resolution at CVPR17. The dataset is composed of 1000 2K resolution RGB images, divided into 800 images for training, 100 images for validation, 100 images for testing. Since the testing set is not available to the public, this project trained the neural network using the training set and tested it with the validation set.

## Super-resolved Results
